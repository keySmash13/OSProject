## How to set up kernel on USC lab computers
First, you'll want to get qemu's risc-v 64-bit emulator so that you have the program qemu-system-riscv64. Then, run ./run.sh. 
This will spawn a window, but you can ignore it. I/O will happen via the terminal emulator you ran the script from.

## How to compile from source
You'll need a GCC toolchain for risc-v ELF binaries to run the makefile.

## Other things
This project is by Adrian Holdcraft and Madison Byrd.
